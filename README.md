## Purpose

Our goal for this project is given some arbitrary Python function, we should be able to profile that function, visualize
the runtime and then output a graph which shows it's runtime in varying sizes.

We aim to do this through command line so in the end we want to have an arbitrary function and then have our program
visualize the profiled code.

User provides the function, data and input size. We handle the code profiling and visualization.

User (provides function, data, input size) -> Profile code -> Generate graph
